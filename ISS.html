                The International Space Station is a large spacecraft in orbit around Earth. It serves as a home where crews of
                astronauts and cosmonauts live. The space station is also a unique science laboratory. Several nations worked together
                to build and use the space station. The space station is made of parts that were assembled in space by astronauts. It
                orbits Earth at an average altitude of approximately 250 miles. It travels at 17,500 mph. This means it orbits Earth
                every 90 minutes. NASA is using the space station to learn more about living and working in space. These lessons will
                make it possible to send humans farther into space than ever before.

                
            </p><br>
            <p>The first piece of the International Space Station was launched in November 1998. A Russian rocket launched the Russian
            Zarya (zar EE uh) control module. About two weeks later, the space shuttle Endeavour met Zarya in orbit. The space
            shuttle was carrying the U.S. Unity node. The crew attached the Unity node to Zarya.
</p><br>
            <p>More pieces were added over the next two years before the station was ready for people to live there. The first crew
            arrived on November 2, 2000. People have lived on the space station ever since. More pieces have been added over time.
            NASA and its partners from around the world completed construction of the space station in 2011.</p><br>
            <p>The space station has the volume of a five-bedroom house or two Boeing 747 jetliners. It is able to support a crew of
            six people, plus visitors. On Earth, the space station would weigh almost a million pounds. Measured from the edges of
            its solar arrays, the station covers the area of a football field including the end zones. It includes laboratory
            modules from the United States, Russia, Japan and Europe. </p>
            <p>.In addition to the laboratories where astronauts conduct science research, the space station has many other parts. The
            first Russian modules included basic systems needed for the space station to function. They also provided living areas
            for crew members. Modules called "nodes" connect parts of the station to each other.</p>
            <p>Stretching out to the sides of the space station are the solar arrays. These arrays collect energy from the sun to
            provide electrical power. The arrays are connected to the station with a long truss. On the truss are radiators that
            control the space station's temperature.<a
