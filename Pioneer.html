                er more than 30 years, it appears the venerable Pioneer 10 spacecraft has sent its last signal to Earth. Pioneer's last,
                very weak signal was received on 23 January 2003. NASA engineers report that Pioneer 10's radioisotope power source has
                decayed, and it may not have enough power to send additional transmissions to Earth. NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) did
                not detect a signal during a contact attempt on 7 February 2003. The previous three contacts, including the 23 January
                signal, were very faint, with no telemetry received. The last time a Pioneer 10 contact returned telemetry data was 27
                April 2002.

            <p>The Pioneer Spacecraft Missions are a series of eight spacecraft missions managed by the Pioneer Project Office at NASA,
            Ames Research Center. The following is a brief description of the other Pioneer Missions.
</p><br>
            <p>Originally designed to operate in space for at least 6 months, the Pioneers proved to be remarkably reliable. Pioneer 9
            failed in 1983. Pioneer 8 was last tracked successfully on 22 August 1996, after being commanded to the backup
            transmitter tube (TWT). Pioneer 7 was last tracked successfully in March 1995. Pioneer 6, the oldest operating
            spacecraft ever, had a track on the 70 meter Deep Space Station 43 in Australia on 6 October 1997. The spacecraft had
            been commanded to the backup TWT in July, 1996. The prime TWT apparently had failed some time after December, 1995. Both
            the MIT and ARC Plasma Analyzers as well as the cosmic ray detector from University of Chicago were turned on and still
            worked after almost 32 years! Limited availability of NASA's Deep Space Tracking Network antennas and the greater
            scientific value of newer space missions led to a discontinuance of the tracking of these spacecraft. However, to mark
            its 35 years in orbit as the oldest extant NASA spacecraft, one last contact was successfully completed on the 70 meter
            Deep Space Station 14 at Goldstone near Barstow, California on 8 December 2000.</p><br>
