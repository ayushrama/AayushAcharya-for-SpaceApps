        In January 2004, two robotic geologists named Spirit and Opportunity landed on opposite sides of the red planet. With
        far greater mobility than the 1997 Mars Pathfinder rover, these robotic explorers have trekked for miles across the
        Martian surface, conducting field geology and making atmospheric observations. Carrying identical, sophisticated sets of
        science instruments, both rovers have found evidence of ancient Martian environments where intermittently wet and
        habitable conditions existed.
  </p><br>
            <p>First among the mission's scientific goals was to search for and characterize a wide range of rocks and soils for clues
            to past water activity on Mars. The rovers were targeted to sites on opposite sides of Mars that looked like they were
            affected by liquid water in the past. Spirit landed at Gusev Crater, a possible former lake in a giant impact crater.
            Opportunity landed at Meridiani Planum, a place where mineral deposits suggested that Mars had a wet history.
            </p><br>
            <p>Each rover bounced onto the surface inside a landing craft protected by airbags. When they stopped rolling, the airbags
            were deflated and the landing craft opened. The rovers rolled out to take panoramic images. These images gave scientists
            the information they needed to select promising geological targets to tell part of the story of water in Mars' past.
            Then, the rovers drove to those locations and beyond to perform close-up scientific investigations.</p><br>
            <p>..Since leaving their landing sites, the twin rovers have sent hundreds of thousands of spectacular, high-resolution,
            full-color images of Martian terrain as well as detailed microscopic images of rocks and soil surfaces to Earth. Four
            different spectrometers have amassed unparalleled information about the chemical and mineralogical makeup of Martian
            rocks and soil. Special rock abrasion tools, never before sent to another planet, have enabled scientists to peer
            beneath the dusty and weathered surfaces of rocks to examine their interiors.</p>
            <p>TWith data from the rovers, mission scientists have reconstructed an ancient past when Mars was awash in water. Spirit
            and Opportunity each found evidence for past wet conditions that possibly could have supported microbial life.
            Opportunity's study of "Eagle" and "Endurance" craters revealed evidence for past inter-dune playa lakes that evaporated
            to form sulfate-rich sands. The sands were reworked by water and wind, solidified into rock, and soaked by groundwater...<a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars-exploration/missions/mars-exploration-rovers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read
